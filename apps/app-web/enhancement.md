**Proposed Enhancement**:
- Implement comprehensive sales tracking with:
  - Real-time sales volume aggregation per user
  - Historical sales performance tracking with time-series data
  - Sales volume breakdown by product category, time period, and network level
  - Predictive analytics for sales forecasting

**Technical Implementation**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_sales_volume (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  period_start DATE,
  period_end DATE,
  total_sales DECIMAL(10,2),
  product_category VARCHAR(100),
  network_level INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_sales_period ON user_sales_volume(user_id, period_start, period_end);
```
