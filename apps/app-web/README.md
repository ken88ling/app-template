| 2     | Indirect Sales | 30%               | 10%                 | 0           | Seller gets 30%, their upline gets 10%      |
| 3     | Points Tier    | 30%               | 0%                  | 10 pts/$100 | Seller gets 30%, upline earns points        |

### Product-Based Commission Rates

   - Level 2: Receives reduced monetary commission
   - Levels 3-4: Earn points instead of direct commission

### Referral System

- **Referral Links**: `/auth/register?referrer={userId}`
