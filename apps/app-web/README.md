|-------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Direct Sales | 30% | 0% | 0 | Direct upline receives 30% of order value |
| 2 | Indirect Sales | 30% | 10% | 0 | Seller gets 30%, their upline gets 10% |
| 3 | Points Tier | 30% | 0% | 10 pts/$100 | Seller gets 30%, upline earns points |
| 4+ | Legacy Tier | 30% | 0% | 5 pts/$100 | Seller gets 30%, higher uplines earn points |

### Product-Based Commission Rates

Different products have specific commission structures based on user roles:

#### User Roles
- **Distributor**: Base level with standard commission rates (1.0x multiplier)
- **Trader**: Mid-level with enhanced commission rates (1.2x multiplier)

#### Sample Product Pricing & Commission Tiers

| Product | Retail Price | Trader Price | Distributor Price | Trader Commission | Distributor Commission |

### Volume-Based Bonus System

Sales volume achievements unlock additional commission bonuses:

| Sales Volume Range | Bonus Percentage | Effective Commission Increase |
